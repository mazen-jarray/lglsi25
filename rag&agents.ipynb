There are currently more media hit pieces lambasting him than targeting Trump. It wouldn’t be too surprising if the Clintons or their allies were to start running attack ads against the FBI.\n",
            "The FBI’s leadership is being warned that the entire left-wing establishment will form a lynch mob if they continue going after Hillary. And the FBI’s credibility is being attacked by the media and the Democrats to preemptively head off the results of the investigation of the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton. \n",

Its bizarre headline, “James Comey Role Recalls Hoover’s FBI, Fairly or Not” practically admits up front that it’s spouting nonsense. The Boston Globe has published a column calling for Comey’s resignation. Not to be outdone, Time has an editorial claiming that the scandal is really an attack on all women.\n"

Top sources include nuts (almonds, hazelnuts), seeds (sunflower, pumpkin), vegetable oils (sunflower, olive), and leafy greens like spinach.  These foods contribute to overall health by protecting cells from damage and supporting immune function.  The article serves as a guide for incorporating Vitamin E-rich foods into a balanced diet.  Specific quantities for optimal intake are not detailed.\n",

A balanced diet incorporating these foods contributes to overall wellness, not solely treating specific conditions.  However, excessive Vitamin E intake (above 1000mg/day) can cause side effects like nausea and bleeding.  Incorporate these foods through additions to salads, smoothies, or as snacks.  Note that mg values vary by serving size; consult nutrition labels.\n",
